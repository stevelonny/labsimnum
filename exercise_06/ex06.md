# Exercise 06
The code is a reimplemantation of exercise_04, but the equilibrations phase is integrated in the simulation phase. The code is not parallelized as the previous one.

Usage:

    ./exercise_06 <simulation_type> [<external_field>]

Where ```<simulation_type>``` cane be either ```2``` for metro or ```3``` for gibbs.
Without ```[<external_field>]``` set, the program computes tenergy, heat capacity and chi with ```h = 0```.
The optional argument ```[<external_field>]``` can be whatever value, it will prompt the program to set the external field to ```h = 0.02``` and it will compute only magnetization values.
