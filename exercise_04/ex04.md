# Exercise 04
This exercise is divided in three parts:
- Equilibration - Generate a bunch of temperatures data to extrapolate starting temperature needed to equilibrate
- Preparation - Prepare the system in a equilibrated state
- Simulation - Run the actual simulation

## exercise_04_eq - [`ex04_eq.cpp`](/exercise_04/ex04_eq.cpp) - _Equilibration_
This program runs 10 simulation for each of the 3 phases at different temperature. Its results are used for estimating equilibration time and starting temperature necessary to achieve the desidered temperature.
On a quadcore i5-10300H, with 100 blocks and 200 steps each block the speed comparison is:

*Single-thread*
```
real    15m59.719s
user    15m55.893s
sys     0m0.335s
```
*Multi-thread*
```
real    3m30.244s
user    21m48.532s
sys     0m0.909s
```
Todo: get rid of output as it is not needed.

## exercise_04_prep - [`ex04_prep.cpp`](/exercise_04/ex04_prep.cpp) - _Preparation_
This program runs simulations to prepare a stable configuration for the desired configurations.
Run 1 single block of the required number of steps (solid: 50000, liquid: 50000, gas: 500000). Saves the output in [data/ex04](/data/ex04/) under ```INPUT_*```.

## exercise_04_sim - [`ex04_sim.cpp`](/exercise_04/ex04_sim.cpp) - _Simulation_
Runs the actual simulation restarting from the input folders generated from the previous code.
